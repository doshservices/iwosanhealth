            <h4>WHY WE COLLECT IT AND THE LEGAL GROUNDS</h4>
            <p>
              IWIL generally collects only the personal information necessary to
              fulfill your request and to provide the requested and/or agreed
              services. Where additional, optional information is sought, you
              will be notified of this at the point of collection. The
              applicable law allows us to process personal information, so long
              as we have a ground under the law to do so. It also requires us to
              tell you what those grounds are. As a result, when we process your
              personal information, we will rely on one of the following
              processing conditions:
            </p>

              <li>
                <strong>Performance of a contract: </strong>
                This is when the processing of your personal information is
                necessary in order to perform our obligations under a contract
                but also to be able to complete our acceptance procedure so as
                to enter into a contract;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal obligation or for public interest: </strong> This
                is when we are required to process your personal information in
                order to comply with a legal obligation, such as keeping records
                for complying with any tax obligations, regulatory purposes, or
                providing information to a public body or law enforcement
                organization;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate interests: </strong>
                where necessary, we may process information about you where
                there is a legitimate interest for us or a third party with
                respect to your health interests, except where such interests
                are overridden by your interests, fundamental rights and
                freedoms; or you expressly deny.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Consent: </strong>
                We may occasionally ask you for specific permission to process
                some of your personal information for some or more specific
                purposes such as research and studies, and we will only process
                your personal information in this way if you so agree.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>What constitutes consent? </strong>

            personal information. We evaluate and update these measures on an
            ongoing basis. Your information is only accessible to personnel who
            need access to the information to perform their duties, However,
            while we take precautions to safeguard your information, we cannot
